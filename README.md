## Made with React 🤌🏻

## Steps 🤓:
-----
- Create a React App.
- Inside the App.js, remove the boilerplate code and create two containers: one for the code editor and the other for the display.
- Inside the containers, create the add the components needed for the code editor. Here, i created two components `Editor` from `Editor.js` and `DisplayContainer` from DisplayContainer.js`.
- `Editor` component: Here, we create the input section for all three components; HTML, CSS and JS. 
- `DisplayContainer` component: This includes an iframe component that would help us display the code in a finished format.
